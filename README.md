ToolScripts
===========

A collection of useful scripts and tools for the linux command line.

All these scripts are provided as is with no guaranteed support or liability from the owner. Though I have tested and used these scripts on my own (Ubuntu 14.04) computer, they are by no means 100% bug-proof!

### autobackup
A command used to backup a file at regular intervals and timestamp them.
